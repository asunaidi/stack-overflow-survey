## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No libraries are needed other than the ones provided by Anaconda. The code was built on Python 3

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I used Stack Overflow data from 2017 to answer the following questions:

Q1: Are the languages used  in industry by professional developers being taught in universities? In other words: Do universities teach students useful materials to prepare them for their future careers as developers?

Q2: I heard in many occasions people saying that it's better to work in a small company as it makes you feel more included and it allows you to handle important projects all by yourself and see the results of your work directly in front of your eyes which is something you won't necessarily get when working for a big company. I also heard other people saying that it's more secure to work in big companies because of their resources. Can this dataset prove any of these rumors?

Q3: What are the strongest motivations behind people leaving their coding job?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one file in this repository named 'project4_stackoverflow.ipynb' in addition to this README file. It's a Jupyter notebook that has all the code needed to answer my questions along with some comments explaining the process.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The answers I was able to interpret from the Stack Overflow data can be seen either on the Jupyter notebook or on this [blog](https://asunaidi.github.io/stackoverflow-blog/).
